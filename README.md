# R Assignments
Assignments done under computational biology department at IIITD.

Code and output files of the assignments are in respective folders.

1. Anscombeâ€™s quartet (graphics, linear regression) data(anscombe) has variables x1,...,x4,y1,...,y4.

a. Fit linear regression models to each pair using eg model1<-lm(y1~x1,data=anscombe)
b. Use summary() to look at the model summaries. The models appear
   identical.
c. Draw the four x-y scatterplots, and use abline() to add the regression
   line to each (perhaps in a contrasting color)
d. Look at the example code in help(anscombe). Try to work out what
   it is doing.

2. Download the data from UCI machine learning repository
   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.
   
   Here the attribute Class (with positive and negative values) is to be modelled
   a) for variable (attributes) which have numerial value, plot the density. 
   b) for data-points lying in positive class make violin plot for two attribute. similarly make violin plot for same attribute value for data-points belonging to negative class. Plot them side by side.
      Check by looking at violin plot if distribution of any attribute is different among data-points belonging to positive or negative class.
   c) Try to model the class using other attributes in the data using linear regression.
